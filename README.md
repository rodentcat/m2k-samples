Requires WADtool: https://github.com/juju2143/wadtool

Put ANDY.IND and ANDY.WAD from the extracted PSX version (Might work with the windows version, but I've only tested the PSX version) into the root of this git, then run release_patcher.bat. It should be in the same folder as that .bat.
Drag and drop wadtool.exe (wherever you stored that) into the command prompt that just popped up, then hit "enter"
Boom, ya got it. Now you can put ANDY.IND and ANDY.WAD back into the software and recompile (is that the word ?) it.
