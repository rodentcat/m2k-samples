NOTE: A lot of samples are pitched up so I could have them be longer when pitched down.
NOTE 2: DO NOT mix and match versions between song saves, the custom samples corrupt if used on a different version than the song uses.
NOTE 3: Each tab alternates between musical samples and percussion samples.
