RODENT CAT WELCOMES YOU
~p TOTAL SAMPLES: 150

This is a modded copy, provided by Rodent Cat. But you can call me Liz.
Custom samples start at the rapping (Danny) section. 
NOTE: A lot of samples are pitched up so I could have them be longer when pitched down.

You can get this on github. rodentcat/m2k-samples
