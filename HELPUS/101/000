RODENT CAT WELCOMES YOU
~p TOTAL SAMPLES: 187
You can get this on github. rodentcat/m2k-samples

This is a modded copy, provided by Rodent Cat. But you can call me Liz.
Custom samples start at the rapping (Danny) section. 

NOTE: A lot of samples are pitched up so I could have them be longer when pitched down.
NOTE 2: DO NOT mix and match versions between song saves, the custom samples corrupt if used on a different version than the song uses.
